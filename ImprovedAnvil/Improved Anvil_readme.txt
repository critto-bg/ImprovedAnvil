Improved Anvil is a mod for BG2 and TOB. It requires TOB.

=====================
What does this mod do?
=====================

1) Tactical challenges and Improved enemies
   
2) Many New quests and encounters

3) New types of monsters
 
4) Fixes and tweaks:
   Improved Anvil applies several corrections and changes (including fixes and tweaks) to the
   original game. For details see the related document which is provided in the download package.

5) Item Randomizer program:
   A novelty introduced by Improved Anvil for the first time: A good number of powerful items
   have been removed from their original locations. Each time you start a new game with Improved
   Anvil, those items will be randomly (and sensibly) redistributed into new and difficult
   locations and/or in the inventory of improved and tough enemies. In other words, each time you
   play the game with this mod, each of those items may be in different places and you won't be
   sure where to look for them.    

6) New item upgrades:
   Cromwell and Cespenar have 101 new item upgrade recipes most of which require brand new
   components which are also added to the game by this mod.

7) Four new kits:
   Two new ranger kits, a new druid kit and a new fighter kit are added to the game. The new kits
   are all available to the protagonist at character creation stage. In addition, the new druid
   kit is assigned to Cernd and one of the new ranger kits is assigned to Valygar as well.

All those experienced players who are tired of playing the same game over and over can now Play
BG2 as if they are playing an entirely new game.

============================
Warnings and important notes:
============================
(1) Improved Anvil is "The mod for the experienced players". It includes some really difficult 
    battles. If you do not have the required level of tactical knowledge, you will need to have
    patience and draw a learning curve for yourself and improve your skills gradually while
    playing the mod. If you don't have the time or the patience for that, you may need to 
    postpone playing this mod to a later time.

(2) Never cheat during the game if you intend to play Improved Anvil. Cheating may look harmless
    at the first glance and may even help you win some battles, but many global variables are
    checking the events during the game and cheating may mess up the events in your game.
    Cheating is not confined to using console commands or using external programs. Any action
    which is deliberately performed to exploit the game's engine is a cheat. Any action which a
    DM would not allow you to perform in a pnp is a cheat as well. See the attached pdf document
    to the following web page: http://forums.blackwyrmlair.net/index.php?showtopic=4067

(3) It is strongly recommended to play Improved Anvil with as many party members as possible.
    Improved Anvil is not designed for solo characters or even for parties with fewer than five
    members. Take your time to choose and collect your desired NPCs normally (no need to hurry)
    in the game, but don't go too far into the game with a party of fewer than 5 members. A full
    party of 6 members is strongly recommended even over a party of 5 members.
