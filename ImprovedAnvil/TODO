Bulian's Todo:

Complete
increased difficulty of a few existing encounters (spellhold book, limak)
added early containers to Irenicus Dungeon to help with inventory management (AR0602 BCS)
enabled The Four encounters to appear for all protagonists in Ch6and increased difficulty of 3/4 of the encounters with adjusted rewards (no more TheFour items)
enabled most mage and ranger stronghold quests (and scrolls/potions rewards) for all protagonists. Ancient Secret of Suldanesslar (Vagrant only) and Old Ones-> Time Machine (necromancer only) remain untouched
additional items in randomizer (blackblood club, harmonium halberd, staff of arundel, rod of smiting, sentinal shield, warblade +4, dragon blade +3)
enabled Justice Day, Flail of Defending and Wounding, Red Coral Armor, Memory of the Apprentice, and Lord of the Underworld to be forged regardless of PC class. Class restrictions on key items appearing or encounters removed
Add names and descriptions of custom items for Minsc, Imoen, Aerie, Dorn
modify cromwell and cespenar dialogue
removed additional randomized items from stores
apprentice robe now 100% if wisdom 18, 50% if wisdom 17 or less
create new items with appropriate flags

remove depreciation - hgkar01.sto, shop01.sto

To do
