                <div class="togglebox">
                    <div>
<pre>
VAGRANT: Vagrants do not stay in a place for long. They spend most of their time exploring new
         wilderness areas and enjoying the beauties of nature. Woodlands and lakes are the most
         favorite places for vagrants. They are very healthy characters with exceptional stamina.
         Vagrants can develop a special kind of friendship with swanmays. Swanmays are very rare
         and special kind of lycanthrope rangers living at lakesides in woodlands and in remote
         temperate wetlands. High level vagrants can call for swanmays' help.

Advantages:

1- +1 bonus to Constitution
2- Immunity to disease and poison
3- +2 bonus to save vs. Paralyze/Death
4- 15% resistance to elemental damage for every 6 levels of experience
5- Can gain grand mastery in using axes
6- Gains the ability to summon Swanmay at levels 13 and 16
7- Gains the ability to summon Greater Swanmay at levels 19 and 22
8- Gains the ability to summon 'Swanmay Queen' at level 25
The swanmays will loyally fight at the vagrant's side for 20 rounds

Disadvantages:

1- May not wear armor greater than studded leather
2- Cannot specialize in ranged weapons
3- Requires 12 Charisma
4- Cannot dual class

                    <div>
<pre>
PROTECTOR: Protectors are dedicated defenders of people and nature. They usually take residence
close to people who are in need of help, but they are also always prepared to travel when the
cause is fighting evil. While being great warriors, they can also learn and cast more spells than
other rangers. Protectors have such a strong affinity with mother nature that they never wear
armors greater than the studded leather. This self-imposed limitation has been compensated with
mental and physical abilities. A protector sacrifices a portion of his own health and stamina to
start learning the special protective methods and abilities of his kit.

Advantages:
- +1 bonus to Armor class for every 6 levels.
- Can memorize 2 additional spells per spell level.
- Has access to two special 3rd level spells (Great Berries & Mental Equilibrium).

- Incurs a -1 penalty to constitution
- Cannot dual class
- Requires 10 Intelligence and Charisma.

Racial Combat:

Once per day, the protector can use this powerful innate ability to be prepared for fighting a
special race of his or her choice. The ability will grant useful bonuses against enemies of the
selected race, but will also make the protector subject to penalties against other races. The
effects (bonuses and penalties alike) won't be dispellable and will remain active for 2 turns.

The detailed bonuses and penalties are as follows:

                <div class="togglebox">
                    <div>
<pre>
RISKBREAKER: Riskbreakers are masters of simultaneous speed and accuracy. They have the ability
to move and attack enemies in a way that only a blurred outline of their bodies can be seen.
Riskbreakers have limited access to two mage spells as innate abilities. High level Riskbreakers
gain unique abilities to break the risk involved in most difficult battles. The trainings required
to become a riskbreaker are very demanding and require the riskbreaker to sacrifice a portion
of his health and stamina during the process. Only Humans can be Riskbreakers.

Advantages:
- +2 Bonus to save vs. Breath Weapon.
- +2 Bonus to Movement Speed.
- Makes critical hits at a roll of 17 or better (instead of the usual 20).
- Gains "Blur" every 5 levels.
- +2 bonus to Armor class for every 6 levels.
- Gains "Improved Haste" at levels 10, 16 and 22.
- Once the Riskbreaker reaches level 15, each of his successful hits will have 15% chance to apply
a random effect picked from the following pool:
  - "Hard Hit" on target (applies 10D6 +5 additional damage),
  - "Risk Increment" on target (applies -4 penalty to AC for 2 rounds),
  - "Avert Risk" (heals the Riskbreaker for 20 HP).
- Gains the ability "Chain Breaker Stance" at levels 17 and 23.
- Gains the innate ability "Risk Decrement" at levels 18, 24 and 30.

Disadvantages:
- Cannot wear any armor.
- Cannot wear any helmet (other than Ioun stones).
- Cannot use gauntlets and shields.
- Cannot use ranged weapons.
- Cannot specialize in two handed weapons.
- Cannot be proficient in single weapon and Two handed weapon styles.
- Receives a -2 Penalty to constitution.
- Is immune to "Spirit Armor" and "Barkskin" spells.

- Cannot dual class.

Chain Breaker Stance:
This ability applies the following effects to the caster for 5 rounds:
- +25% resistance to physical damage
- 25 strength
- Regenerating 12 HP per round

Risk Decrement:
When surrounded by lots of enemies and when most other warriors may fall or surrender in despair,
a high level riskbreaker is more than capable to break the risk involved in the toughest situations.

Risk Decrement has the following effects:
- Heals the riskbreaker completely.
- Applies a massive attack to all enemies around the riskbreaker inflicting 8D10 crushing damage
  with no saving throw.
- Has a good chance to throw back all or some of the enemies.

                <h4 class="title">Champion of Arvoreen</h4>
                <div class="togglebox">
                    <div>
<pre>
CHAMPION OF ARVOREEN: Arvoreen is the nearest thing to a halfling war god. He is of stern defense
and aggressive watchfulness, always preparing for incursions into halfling lands and making ready
to repulse hostile creatures at the first sign of trouble. Arvoreen is not exactly a popular power
among most halflings and his priests are often perceived as overly serious and "grumpy as dwarves"
by the Small Folk.

Being a champion of Arvoreen is the closest thing to a paladin that a halfling can strive to become.
The narrowness of society's views on what is right and wrong does not permit a member of the Small Folk
to be pronounced as a holy warrior. It does not mean, however, that he may not be courageous
and decent at heart.

Champions of Arvoreen are brave and honest warriors. While they might lack the advanced expertise and knowledge
of melee combat, Champions fight against evil fiercely and selflessly, and their God rewards their devotion
with powers a mere swordsman would never attain.

Advantages:
- May achieve Grandmastery (five slots) in all weapons that are favoured by the Small Folk:
Short Swords, Daggers, Short Bows and Slings.
- May use two innate abilities once per day: Prayer to Arvoreen and Invoke Courage.
- May use the Lay on Hands ability. Gains one use at levels 9, 15 and 21.
- Gains the ability Blessed Watchfulness at level 11.
- Gains the ability Shield of Light at level 12.
- Gains a +3 bonus to Dexterity at level 16.
- Gains a permanent 1/2 bonus to attacks per round at level 22.

Disadvantages:
- Race restricted to Hafling.
- Alignment restricted to Lawful Good.
- May not exceed Mastery (three slots) in single-handed weapons.
- May not exceed Specialization (two slots) in any other weapon.
- May not achieve any proficency in two-handed weapon style.

PRAYER TO ARVOREEN: When a Champion of Arvoreen uses this ability, she calls upon Arvoreen to grant her strength
so she may overcome whatever obstacle lies ahead. The power of the prayer increases along with her devotion to her
god. The ability grants a +20 bonus to maximum HP, +2 bonus to AC and regeneration rate of 1 HP every 2 seconds.
At 13th it becomes 30 HP, +3 bonus to AC and regeneration rate of 1 HP every second. And, finally, at 19th level
the bonuses reach the values of 40 maximum HP, +4 bonus to AC and regeneration rate of 2 HP every second.
The effect lasts for 2 turns.

INVOKE COURAGE: When a Champion of Arvoreen uses this ability, he becomes immune to fear
and gains a +1 bonus to THAC0 as well as to all Saving Throws. At 13th level, the Champion
receives extra +1 bonus and another one at 18th level, to a total of +3. The effect lasts for 2 turns.

LAY ON HANDS: The Champion of Arvoreen channels positive energy to heal the touched creature.
The power and benefical effects of the ritual grow along with the Champion's spiritual strength.
- at 9th level, the spell restores 16 hit points and cleanses all poisons;
- at 11th level, the spell restores 28 hit points and cleanses all poisons and diseases;
- at 13th level, the spell restores 34 hit points, cleanses poisons and diseases, removes curses and paralysis;
- at 15th level, the spell also restores all the energy drained from afflicted person by a vampire
 or similar creature;
- at 19th level, the power of the spell grows to a value of 50 hit points;
- at 21th level, the power of the spell grows to a value of 75 hit points;
- at 25th level, the spell completely heals the touched creature and all afflictions that ail him.

BLESSED WATCHFULNESS: By casting this spell, the caster confers exceptional powers of observation and alertness
to one creature for the duration of the spell. While Blessed Watchfulness is in effect, the designated sentinel
remains alert, awake, and vigilant. Those under the effect of this spell resist any spells or effects that could
lower their guards or force them to abandon their watches, including charm, beguiling, fear, emotion, and similar
mind-affecting spells. The ability also grants protection from backstab.
The effects are undispellable and last for 15 rounds.

SHIELD OF LIGHT: This powerful spell grants the caster undispellable protection from level drain as well as
+15% bonus resistance to physical damage for the duration of 15 rounds.

<pre>
AURAMASTER: Auramasters can use the magical aura and energy spread and floating in the nature and
to weave and cast spells faster and more frequently than ordinary spellcasters. They also can
cast spells which are not available to other druids. The new spells are duplicates of a few
wizard spells as well as some entirely new spells.

   day to regenerate 24 hp per round for 10 rounds. While in contact with nature, the auramaster
   is also immune to petrification and imprisonment.
7- At level 22, gains the innate ability, Aura of invulnerability, which acts as a shield of
   energy, absorbing 40% of all physical damage as well as granting +6 bonus to AC for 12 rounds.
   The ability can be used but once per day.

Descriptions of the new spells:

Unleash Energy:

Level: 6
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One target
Range: Caster's visual sight
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell unleashes an outstanding bolt of energy which inflicts 10d8 points of magic
damage to a single target.

Aura Cleansing:
It is the same as the mage HLA, Improved Alacrity.

Perfect Camouflage (Abjuration)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 20 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Casting this powerful spell makes the Auramaster druid invisible and immune to all divination
spells for the duration of the spell. If the druid attacks or casts offensive spells during this
period of time, he or she will become partially visible and will be subject to physical attack,
but no spell can be directly cast on him or her. Note that this spell doesn't make the caster
immune to those spells which affect an area instead of an individual target. Since Auramasters
cast spells more quickly than other spellcasters, the effective casting time of this spell is 3.
A successful remove magic can dispel the effects of this spell.

                <h4 class="title">Shaman</h4>
                <div class="togglebox">
                    <div>
<pre>
Shamans forge a divine connection with the natural world, similar to the way Druids commune with nature, but Shamans are more spiritual than primal.
They directly tap into the energies that flow through the earth and air, through plants and animals, and even through the dead, and shape these energies
to obey their will. Nowhere is this more evident than in their ability to summon powerful spirits as guardians and defenders. A being of two worlds,
Shamans value balance, physical and spiritual, over dominance.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May only wear leather, studded leather, and hide armor.
– May not equip shields larger than bucklers.
– May only use the following weapons: dagger, club, spear, axe, quarterstaff, dart, sling, and shortbow.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any fighting style.
– May cast druidic spells.
– Does not automatically learn all spells of a given level as Druids do. Instead, Shamans select new spells to learn at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.
– Gains access to a healing technique called mending. Mending spells are the improved versions of the healing spells that supplement their original counterparts inside the spell book upon learning.
– Gains immediate access to a number of additional spells, which can be cast like any other:
  Level 1: Spirit Ward
  Level 2: Resist Fear, Soothing Fog
  Level 3: Protection from Cold, Spiritual Clarity
  Level 4: Spiritual Weapon, Spirit Fire
  Level 5: Entropy Shield, Recall Spirit
  Level 6: Impervious Sanctity of Mind, Primal Ward
  Level 7: Storm Shell, Sense of Limbo
– Gains use of the Detect Illusion skill with 20% points as a base and an 4 points per level, up to a maximum of 100% at level 20.
– May use Shamanic Dance at will.
– May use Spirit Shift once per day.
– Does not gain bonus spells per day from high Wisdom.
– Alignment restricted to neutral good, true neutral, and neutral evil.
– Hit Die: d8

MENDING: This is a special variety of healing spells. These spells are pronounced faster than the regular curing magic.
Starting at level 17th, mending spells give a short-term aura cleansing ability that lasts for the next second, allowing Shaman
to transition fluidly from healing to regular spellcasting within the span of a single round. The aura cleansing effect disperses
when a regular spell is cast. Mending is an innate technique that is given automatically when a regular healing spell is learned.

SHAMANIC DANCE: Shamans can summon spirit allies by performing a ritualistic dance. While dancing, the Shaman takes a -4 penalty to Armor Class
and cannot move, attack, cast spells, use items and special abilities, or perform any other activity. Each round while the Shaman dances, there is
a 35% base chance plus 2% for each level of the Shaman that a spirit will answer the call, up to a maximum of 75% at level 20.
Any summoned spirits will disappear if the Shaman moves, stops dancing, or if the spirits leave visual range. The spirits grow in power as the Shaman gains additional levels:
  Level 1: Minor animal spirits (snake, fox, hound), up to 2 spirits at the same time.
  Level 6: Major animal spirits (bear, panther, boar), up to 3 spirits at the same time.
  Level 12: Minor nature spirits (lesser air spirit, lesser earth spirit, lesser fire spirit), up to 4 spirits at the same time.
  Level 18: Major nature spirits (air spirit, earth spirit, fire spirit), up to 5 spirits at the same time.

The type of the summoned spirit is randomly determined from all the spirits available at the Shaman's level. For example, a level 12 Shaman
will summon either a minor nature spirit, a major animal spirit, or a minor animal spirit, but cannot choose which one appears. Spirits will do
their best to protect the Shaman but are not controlled directly.

SPIRIT SHIFT: From the moment of their initiation, Shamans gain the ability to step out of the material plane and give way to a spiritual entity
that posesses their body for a short duration. As the power of Shaman grows, so does his ability to conjure a stronger spirit and bind it for a
longer period of time. Starting at level 1, Shaman may transform into a mighty spiritual warrior for 3 rounds. The power and resilience of the warrior
grows at levels 9, 12 and 16. At level 20 the warrior's strength reaches its peak and duration increases to 4 rounds. At level 24, the duration increases to 5 rounds.

                <div class="togglebox">
                    <div>
<pre>
A member of a special sect within the druidic order, a Druid of this type is dedicated
to fighting those who would defile nature. Avengers have combat powers the average Druid does not —
additional abilities that have been earned through extensive training, rituals and communions
with entities from higher planes, a process that is very physically draining and forces them
to give up some of their affinity towards nature and special powers that come with it.

Advantages:
- Gains two stars in two-handed weapon mastery.
- May achieve mastery in staffs and spears.
- May achieve specialization in weapons that are allowed to the druid domain.
- Seven spells are added to the repertoire, all the way up to the 7th level. These are listed below:

1st level: Remove Fear.
2nd level: Draw Upon Holy Might.
3rd level: Protection from Cold.
4rd level: Holy Power.
5th level: Righteous Magic.
6th level: Giant Strength.
7th level: Protection from the Elements.

- May use Combat Trance ability once per day. Gains one use at level 13 and an additional use
every 6 levels thereafter.
- At 9th level, receives a special ability Conjure Clan Spirit.
- Gains a special high level ability Perform Ritual.

Disadvantages:
- May not wear armor heavier than studded leather.
- Does not receive the usual druidic immunities and bonuses.
- Does not possess the ability to shapeshift.
- Cannot become proficient in ranged weaponry and single weapon.
- Lacks the ability to cast certain powerful druidic spells.
- Cannot dual class.

COMBAT TRANCE: From the early days, Avengers are trained to enter a trance-like state of focus.
This skill, similar in spirit to focused rage of a barbarian, is achieved purely through physical training
and conditioning. It allows the druid to become faster and stronger in melee combat.
When in a trance state, the druid gains +1 extra attack per round and +2 bonus
to attack and damage rolls for 1 turn.

CONJURE CLAN SPIRIT: Members of the Avenger sect practice a ritual that brings them into
a state of shared consciousness. As their grasp on each others' internal energy increases,
the clan members gain an ability to summon forth an ancestral spirit. The spectre will possess
abilities and powers of the source, but the strength depends directly on the summoner's experience.

PERFORM RITUAL: This ability allows the Avenger to perform a secret ritual that was perfected by members
of the order. It is the ultimate reason why the druid has to sacrifice his connection to the nature.
When the ritual is initiated, the Avenger attains a state of etherealness, as if stepping
outside the material plane. Entering such state allows the Avenger to move faster and avoid
constrictive areas. Due to his partial presense in the physical world, the druid becomes harder to hit
by the ordinary melee attacks. Any type of magic that constricts movement has no effect.
The duration of the ability equals one turn.

Abilities:
 - +5 Bonus to Armor Class
 - +1 Bonus to movement speed
 - Improved Haste
 - Immunity to Web, Improved Web and Vortex Web
 - Immunity to Slow, Hold and Stun effects

This is a killer trained in discreet and efficient murder, relying on anonymity and surprise
to perform his task.
