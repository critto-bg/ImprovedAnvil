The construction of the ring may have led to their enmity, as each of the gem's nine facets was supposedly empowered by sacrifice and death.

The boots are made of light but strongly enchanted leaves. The boots were once reforged and changed to Boots of The Ranger Lord. Now they are improved again to reach their ultimate power. An incident which can even confirm the opinion of those who believe that such fantastic boots must have a divine element involved.

@203 = ~Treefolk's Arm +3

This enchanted club is said to have existed since the time of the fall of Netheril and the birth of the great Anauroch Desert. While the toll on civilization was great, the true victims were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those that remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed the item's ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

The weapon has recently been upgraded to actualize all of its original potentials.

This blade belonged to Ho Mang, a traveler from Kara-Tur who accepted dubious service at court throughout Faerun. Skilled in "persuasion", he would use this sword to perform the "Death of A Thousand Cuts", an ancient ritual from his homeland involving a lengthy series of small, painful incisions. The properties of the blade prevent blood from clotting, and the victim slowly bleeds to death. The sword was stolen, and its whereabouts have been a mystery until now.

After being combined with the legendary 48-sided garnet, the sword has regained the powers it had on the old days when it was used for the ancient ritual.

A foreigner from the east who went by the name of Floating Bear became well known through the Sword Coast.  Unarmed and unarmored he bested many powerful warriors.  One night, in the arms of a lady of the night he whispered his secret.  His martial arts training was supplemented by the thin gauntlets he wore, which allowed him to hit more accurately and with harder punches than bare fists would normally allow.  The woman stole the gloves and took the next boat out.  Floating Bear soon left, returning to his homeland.

After being combined with The Hand of Dace and Gauntlets of Weapon Expertise, the gauntlets have much better offensive abilities. They are now ideal for any monk, though they are still usable by other character classes, too.

To enchant a katana is no simple process. Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword.

@300 = ~Large Shield +1, +4 vs. Missiles: 'Shield of the Falling Stars'

Ilmater himself enchanted this shield upon seeing a young squire's willingness to endure untold agony for the wellbeing of his mount. During a fierce battle between a human cavalry division and a hobgoblin horde, the young man was sent for reinforcements. He was beset by a cascade of arrows that nearly blocked out the sun, and he knew that even if he avoided the arrows himself, should his horse fall he would surely be doomed. With his shield and body he positioned himself to take the brunt of the onslaught, and was mortally wounded for it. His horse remained unscathed allowing for their escape, and his body was carried back to the nearest town, where he was resurrected from death.

A social faux pas placed upstart Andor Licon in a duel with Baron Eeirk, heir to a warrior king. Though they seemed of even skill, Andor grew oddly weaker with each hit of the Baron's family blade. Panicking, he bade his bodyguards kill Eeirk. Despite his claims of morality, some noted that the young noble had positioned his men before the duel was even underway, and though he professed disdain for its dark magic, Andor made a tidy fortune off the sale of the evil blade.

@312 = ~This flail has been in the care of Lord Arnise for some time, a relic of his adventuring youth. It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiated when compiled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity for magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, 'losing' it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease. It also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.

Carsomyr (this weapon) is a template you can use to forge the holy avenger if you can find its lost scabbard.

This swarm gathers at a point chosen by the caster, within the spell's range, and attacks any single creature the caster points to. The victim may make a saving throw vs. breath weapons to escape the swarm. Otherwise, the victim receives 1 point of damage every two seconds for the duration of the spell. The victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class. The swarm will repeatedly bite the target, making it very difficult to cast spells (50% spell failure).~

Creatures in the insect plague, regardless of Armor Class, sustain 1 point of damage for every two seconds they remain within, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. Targets will escape the swarm if they successfully save vs. breath weapon (with a -2 penalty).~

The next attack that the priest makes will inflict this effect, however he only has 2 rounds to make the attack before the spell fizzles.

@394 = ~Contingency (Evocation)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 day/level

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of his repertoire of known spells. One spell level for every three levels of the caster is allowed up to 18th level or 6th level spells. Once the spell is chosen the caster is allowed to choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of his/her hit points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically. For example a 12th level wizard could place the spell stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being 'the wizard reaches 50% of his hit points'. Then in combat once the wizard is reduced to 50% of his hit points or below, stoneskin would be immediately cast upon him. This requires no action by the wizard, it happens automatically and instantaneously. The limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster. Therefor it cannot be an offensive spell and cannot target any other party members.~

@395 = ~Nahal's Reckless Dweomer* (Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 1
Range: Special
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is the wild mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.

To use Reckless Dweomer, simply cast it and then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the wild mage tries to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (found in your manual).

Because the release of energy is planned by the mage, his level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result may be beneficial to the mage or it may be completely disastrous; this is the risk the mage takes in casting Nahal's reckless dweomer.~

Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: 20 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature or item
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the wizard makes the creature or object touched undetectable by the first divination spell cast in the area provided that the target's stealth is not due to any inivisibility spell. It also prevents location by such magical items as crystal balls and ESP medallions. It does not affect the know alignment spell.~

@8958 = ~RISKBREAKER~
@8959 = ~Riskbreaker~
@8960 = ~RISKBREAKER: Riskbreakers are masters of simultaneous speed and accuracy. They have the ability to move and attack enemies in a way that only a blurred outline of their bodies can be seen. Riskbreakers have limited access to two mage spells as innate abilities. High level Riskbreakers gain unique abilities to break the risk involved in most difficult battles. The trainings required to become a riskbreaker are very demanding and require the riskbreaker to sacrifice a portion of his health and stamina during the process. Only Humans can be Riskbreakers.

@8961 = ~PROTECTOR~
@8962 = ~Protector~
@8963 = ~PROTECTOR: Protectors are dedicated defenders of people and nature. They usually take residence close to people who are in need of help, but they are also always prepared to travel when the cause is fighting evil. While being great warriors, they can also learn and cast more spells than other rangers. Protectors have such a strong affinity with mother nature that they never wear armors greater than the studded leather. This self-imposed limitation has been compensated with mental and physical abilities. A protector sacrifices a portion of his own health and stamina to start learning the special protective methods and abilities of his kit.

Advantages:
- +1 bonus to Armor class for every 6 levels.

@9012 = ~Halberd +4 Blackmist

This was the weapon of Dominique Harl, a sightless paladin who frequently traveled Faerun. When attacked, Dominique would unleash the black mist that is this halberd's namesake, potentially blinding all within ten feet.

Dominique eventually fell, his body found in a dark forest, slain by a creature of the night even more at home in the shadows than he.

@9013 = ~Spellstrike (Abjuration)
Level: 9
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast at a target creature, it will dispel all of the magical protections that surround that creature. This includes: Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Turning and Spell Shield. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

@9014 = ~Lower Resistance (Abjuration)
Level: 5
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Target creature
Saving Throw: None

When cast upon a target creature this spell will lower the magic resistance of this creature by 10% + 1% per level of the caster. There is no saving throw vs. this spell and magic resistance is ignored. For example if a creature has 60% magic resistance and this spell is cast on it by a 15th level mage then its magic resistance would be lowered by 25% automatically. This effect is cumulative for each casting of this spell. If this spell was cast upon this same creature again the creatures magic resistance would be 60% - 25% (initial casting) - 25% (current casting) which would leave the creature with 10% magic resistance after both spells have been cast. This spell will last until the spell duration expires. Something to note is that this spell is not affected by dispel magic. Once it has been cast there is no way to cancel the effects until the spell expires.~

@9015 = ~True Seeing (Divination)

Range: 0

Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, an area roughly 70 feet in radius around the caster will be effected. Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile illusion/phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled. The spells that are affected by this are: Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-detection, Improved Invisibility and Shadow Door. The area of effect is roughly a 70' radius around the caster. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell. This spell only affects enemies, thus it is unable to dispel the invisibility from a party member.~

@9016 = ~Kundane +2: Sword of Quickness

Disfigured as a child, Dramnek Olk was ostracized and ridiculed by his peers. In his loneliness he spent many hours alone on the hills overlooking Trademeet. A nearby wizard, Galloma discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul. The two fast became friends; master and apprentice. Galloma died before Dramnek's tutorage could be completed however and the youth found himself once more alone in the world. Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla. There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma. Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced Dramnek's weak physical body. This weapon has no speed factor.

@9046 = ~Ring of Gaxx
This ring is relatively unadorned, but the vile magic within radiates intense evil. Indeed, its creator, Kangaxx, was no less evil himself, even before millennia of undeath honed his power. It is said that a cadre of Netheril mages fought and imprisoned the demilich once, but being unable to truly destroy him they became liches themselves to stand guard over his remains. The construction of the ring may have led to their enmity, as each of the gem's nine facets was supposedly empowered by sacrifice and death.

@9047 = ~Mace of Disruption +2
This heavy mace was created for a very specific purpose: to slay undead. Any such creature hit by it not only feels the sting of weapon, but also has a chance of being simply blasted from existence. There are legends that speak of a priest so holy a single glancing touch could send a vampire to oblivion, but whether the weapon empowered her or she empowered it is a topic for theologians. Now that the mace has been coated with illithium, it is a more potent weapon with higher enchantment which canpossibly hit some stronger undead creatures and deals more damage to them.

@9048 = ~Invisibility 10' radius
(Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes all creatures within 10' of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature(s) are not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature(s) detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature(s) or their gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature(s) become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature(s). The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 5 turns have passed. The invisible being(s) cannot open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc. If they attack, they immediately become visible, although the invisibility enables them to attack first.~

@9049 = ~Resist Fear
(Abjuration)
Level: 2
Range: 10 yards
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Special

The wizard instills courage in the spell recipients, raising their morale to its highest.  The recipients' morale will gradually reset to normal as the duration runs out.  If the recipients are affected by magical fear, they will regain their composure.~

@9050 = ~Spell Shield (Abjuration)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 20 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast the wizard is protected from the next magical attack against him. The spells that this protects the wizard from are: Spell Thrust, Secret Word, Breach, Lower Resistance, Pierce Magic, Ruby Ray of Reversal, Warding Whip and Pierce Shield (but not Spellstrike). If one of these spells is cast at the wizard this spell activates and absorbs the attack. However, this only works once as this spell is consumed in the process. Otherwise, it will last for the duration. This spell and Spell Immunity: Abjuration are mutually inconsistent with each other and can't both be active on a character. Moreover, Spell Shield can't be cast more frequently than once every 2 turns (unless it is removed by the spellstrike spell).~

@9051 = ~Chaotic Commands (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Sphere: Chaos
Range:  Visual sight of caster

Saving Throw: None

When a mage casts a find traps spell, all traps - concealed normally or magically - of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to him. Once each round all of the traps within a 30 foot radius of the caster will be revealed. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such.~

Basalin was a large man, rumored, far from his hearing, to be a were-bear. He long wielded the sword Albruin in the protection of his village, slaying giant spiders that plagued the area.

Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Tenser's Partial transformation is a moderate version of Tenser's sixth level spell. The advantage of this spell is that it doesn't disable the mage's spell casting ability. While under the effect of this spell, all of the caster's attacks are made with a THAC0 of a 14th level fighter. This spell doesn't grant other bonuses of the 6th level spell. The effect is not dispellable and lasts for the duration of the spell. The effects of the two Tenser's Transformation spells are not cumulative.~

Trying to profit from the strength of greater beings, many years ago the mage Ullion founded a dragon-worshipping cult under the moniker "Son of Drago." Attracting followers with promises of conquest, he sought to secure his authority by enchanting this symbolic weapon for his bodyguard, Jaramor Bold. When the Dragon's Breath strikes an opponent it releases the harsh flames of a red dragon, the poisonous vapor of the green dragon, the blue dragon's lightning bolt, a spray of a black dragon's acid, and the white dragon's penetrating cold. Unfortunately, Ullion was the first to feel its effects, slain by the ambitious Jaramor who sought to rule. There was no real power to be had without the mage, so the entire organization soon collapsed on itself.

Saving Throw: None

NOTE: This scroll can only be used to learn the Time Stop spell, not to cast it directly. Any such attempt will destroy the scroll.

Upon casting a time stop spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop for one round in the area of effect.  Inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for three rounds of apparent time. The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of the time clock. (The spell duration is subjective to the caster.) Nothing can enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also.  When the spell duration ceases, the wizard is again operating in normal time.  Note that all spells cast during the timestop will take effect immediately after time returns to normal.~

This staff was the culmination of a cycle of seasons in which Cernd meditated on his role within nature. His perch for this personal journey was next to a sapling, a young oak that was a particular interest of study; it seemed odd, and yet somehow wonderfully ordered. At the coming of spring Cernd examined it one last time, and it came loose in his hands, a living staff, granted as boon from nature herself. It has grown to fit his grip, and few others may wield it.

The oaken staff, which was once improved to retrieve all of its original powers, is now enhanced even further to be one of the most powerful weapons of Nature.

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: The Caster
Saving Throw: None

Chain contingency channels some of the magical energy of the mage and releases it only under certain circumstances. Basically, the mage chooses three spells, which will be released under certain conditions such as being hit by an enemy. When this condition occurs all three spells are cast immediately. Spells of 8th level or lower may be used in the contingency. Chain Contingency spell can't be cast again during the same day. Moreover, it precludes the possibility to cast the 6th level spell, 'Contingency' for one day.

The wizard gestures with his hand and the entire area around him erupts in flames, striking all except for the caster.

@10000 = ~Bring me Imoen, the sorceress.~

@10001 = ~STALKER: Stalkers serve as covert intelligence-gatherers, comfortable in both wilderness and urban settings. They are the spies, informants, and interrogators, and their mastery of stealth makes them deadly opponents.

Advantages:

-  May backstab for a lesser amount than the thief class (level 1-8: x2, level 9-16: x3, level 17+: x4)
-  Has access to two mage spells at 12th level. They are Haste and Protection from Normal Missiles.

Disadvantages:

Advantages:
-  May coat his weapon in poison once per day per 4 levels. The next hit with that weapon will inject the poison into the target, dealing out 2 damage per second for 12 seconds. A saving throw vs. poison limits damage to 12 total. The weapon will remain poisoned for 3 rounds.

-  Bonus +1 to hit and +1 damage
-  Backstab reaches x7 instead of x5

Disadvantages:
-  Only 15% per level to distribute on abilities~

@10003 = ~Just what? Out with it, girl. I won't have a party member stealing from me. I wonder what kind of things you might do if you were actually skilled in thievery rather than sorcery.~

@10004 = ~INQUISITOR: The Inquisitor has dedicated his life to finding and eliminating practicioners of evil magic and defeating the forces of darkness, and his god has provided him with special abilities towards that end.

Advantages:
-  May cast 'True Sight' once per day per 4 levels (starts at 1st level with one use)
-  Immune to Hold and Charm spells
-  May use 'Dispel Magic' ability once per day per 4 levels (starts at 1st level with one use): ability is used at speed factor 1 and acts at a higher level than his actual level according to the following table:
- At levels 1 - 3, the dispelling power is 1 level higher than the actual level.
- At levels 4 - 5, the dispelling power is 2 levels higher than the actual level.
- At levels 6 - 8, the dispelling power is 3 levels higher than the actual level.

Disadvantages:
-  May not use 'lay on hands' ability
-  May not cast priest spells
-  May not turn undead~

@10005 = ~You're more intelligent than that, Imoen. Did you become a sorceress by accident, discovering that you can cast arcane spells without needing a spell book one day?~

@10006 = ~Actually, yes; though I can't exactly remember when and how it happened first.~

@10007 = ~You do not have the required wardstone to use the stairs.~

@10008 = ~Gorion was like a father, no less was the old Winthrop. He was the innkeep, and he taught me to use my wits and such.~

@10009 = ~Ooo, an archmage! I like the sound of that! But you forgot to say 'wise'. All of the sorceresses in Winthrop's books were wise and terrible. Watch, see? See how I scheme and glare at you... don't I look evil?~

@10010 = ~You failed to save Auriel. You die with pain.~

@10011 = ~And what of Imoen, the eternal child? She had long stood in the shadow of <CHARNAME>, but she was her own person, and would find her fate where she pleased. She returned to Candlekeep for a time, her formidable skill in magic granting a greater appreciation for its tomes. It was smaller than she remembered, however, and she did not stay long. Later she was seen in such vaunted company as Khelben "Blackstaff" and Elminster, by all accounts encouraging them to not be such stick-in-the-muds. Her influence grew over time. When asked of this she always answered with a smile of purest innocence. "Heya," she would say, "it's just me, Imoen."~

@10012 = ~Power Word, Kill (conjuration,summoning)
Level: 9
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When a Power Word, Kill spell is uttered, one creature within the spell range is slain. The power word slays a creature with up to 59 hit points. Even if the creature's maximum hit points are higher than 59, the current hit points are used for this determination. There is no saving throw. This spell has no effect if the target has more than 59 hit points.~

@10013 = ~Item Randomizer successfully initiated.~

@10014 = ~I know who you are, Slave Lords! I intend to rid the earth of your evil.~

@10015 = ~Bring me Cernd, the auramaster druid.~

@10016 = ~Tenser's Transformation (Alteration)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Tenser's transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power. For when the wizard casts the spell, he undergoes a startling transformation. The size and strength of the wizard increase to heroic preportions, so he becomes a formidable fighting machine. The spell causes the caster to become a berserk fighter. The wizard's hit points double, and all damage he sustains comes first from the magical points gained. The armor class of the wizard is 4 better than he possessed prior casting the spell, up to a maximum armor class of -10. All attacks are as a fighter of the same level as the wizard (i.e. the wizard uses the combat values normally reserved for fighters). As well, each attack is made at +2, and each successful hit in combat inflicts an additional 2 points of damage. The effect lasts for the duration and cannot be dispelled by any magical means. This spell will have no effect if it is cast after the 8th level spell, Tenser's Partial Transformation. The effects of these two spells are not cumulative.

NOTE: This spell does not give the caster any extra attacks.~

@10017 = ~Handcuffed~

@10018 = ~The Spell Shield spell can't be cast more frequently than once every 2 turns.~

@10019 = ~IA tip: The fifth level wizard spell, Spell Shield, can't be cast more frequently than once every 2 turns.~

@10020 = ~IA tip: You can use the fifth level wizard spell, Spell Immunity, to give the caster immunity to a single school of spells at a time; multiple uses of this spell will not cumulatively stack.~

@10021 = ~IA tip: Ruby Ray of Reversal is the only spell which can remove Spell Immunity: Abjuration.~

@10022 = ~IA tip: Don't put spells which require touching enemies into your contingencies.~

@10023 = ~IA tip: The spell 'Absolute Immunity' makes the caster immune to all weapons as well as spells that require a to-hit roll, such as Harm.~

@10024 = ~IA tip: Some items are not where they were in the original game; their locations are randomized. Be sure to search for them whilst adventuring.~

@10025 = ~IA tip: It's strongly recommended to play most of the game with a party of 5 or 6.~

@10026 = ~IA tip: There are now some items which cannot be used by Thieves or Bards with the ability 'Use Any Item'~

@10035 = ~Vocalize (Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell can cast spells with a verbal component without having to make any noise. Effectively, this spell cancels the effect of silence (except 'Greater silence' and 'Grave Silence'). This spell has no effect on other noises or speech - it simply removes a spell's verbal component.~

@10036 = ~Enhanced Bard Song
This is a powerful aid to both the bard and to his allies. The song gives the bard himself a 10 point bonus to his AC and 20% magic resistance bonus due to the power of the song. The song also gives his allies +4 to hit, +4 to damage, -4 to AC, +10% magic resistance and immunity to normal weapons.

This ability replaces the current Bard Song.~

@10037 = ~SKALD: This Nordic bard is also a warrior of great strength, skill and virtue. His songs are inspiring sagas of battle and valor, and the Skald devotes his life to those pursuits.

Advantages:
- +1 to hit and +1 damage with all weapons
- The skald's song is different from the typical bard and varies with level:
1st: gives allies +2 to hit, +2 to damage and -2 to AC
15th: gives allies +3 to hit, +3 to damage, -3 to AC
20th: gives allies +4 to hit, +4 to damage, -4 to AC

Disadvantages:
-  Pick pockets ability one-quarter normal~

@10038 = ~This Figurine of Wondrous Power that calls forth from the ether the moon dog Cerebus. Cerebus will obey the owner of the figurine if he so chooses. Unlike similar figurines, Cerebus serves through his desire to combat evil and forward the cause of righteousness and is not bound by the magic of the figurine.

STATISTICS:

Cerebus may be summoned once per day, for fifty rounds. Cerebus has 4 attacks per round and his attacks are considered of +3 enchantment to determine what it can hit.~

@10039 = ~Spell Turning (Abjuration)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the wizard to rebound upon the original caster. This effects a total of 12 spell levels, for example 4 3rd-level, or 1 6th and 1 7th-level, etc.. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard as well as area effects that are stationary such as cloud kill and stinking cloud. As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard it will be reflected back upon the caster. Something to note is that as long as there are levels remaining then the spell will be reflected. For example if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be reflected while cancelling the spell turning. This spell will not protect the caster from dispel magic. However it will not be affected by dispel magic either.~

@10040 = ~This potion, once fully consumed, will completely absorb electrical attacks directed at the imbiber for the duration of the effect, which in this case is 10 turns.

STATISTICS:

Electrical Resistance:  100% immunity

Saving Throws: +3 bonus
Dexterity: -9 penalty
Duration: 5 turns~

@10042 = ~Soon you may return to fight for ascension within the Grove. Until that day comes, I shall not call on you. Go forth and find the path of balance within your life. But once you take the leadership of the grove, you may have new visitors there. You still have important duties to perform.~

@10043 = ~Heeding the Spirit of the Grove

Loren, the descendant of Marek and future leader of the grove once I have moved on, has been saved and the creature that possessed him destroyed. Loren has been brought to the grove for his training, and the spirit informs me that I will not be called on by her again, but as the leader of the grove, I will have other visitors and more duties to accomplish.~

@10047 = ~True Sight (Divination)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 70' radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, an area roughly 70 feet in radius around the caster will be effected. Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile illusion/phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled. The spells that are affected by this are: Refected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-detection, Improved Invisibility and Shadow Door. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell. This spell only affects enemies, thus it is unable to dispel the invisibility from a party member.~

@10048 = ~Chain Contingency - Giant Strength~

@10049 = ~There is a Chain Lightning scroll which will cost 250 gold in supplies, Abi Dalzim's Horrid Wilting at 1000 gold, and Meteor Swarm at 2500 gold. That is also the order of difficulty.~

@10050 = ~I imagine this will be the safest one. Try to make the Chain Lightning scroll.~

@10051 = ~Very well. We'll start working on the Chain Lightning scroll.~

@10052 = ~There is Chain Lightning which will cost 250 gold in supplies, Horrid Wilting at 1000 gold, and Meteor Swarm at 2500 gold. That is also the order of difficulty.~

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Casting this spell grants the wizard protection from one spell school of her choice. After the spell is cast, the wizard must choose the school she wishes to be protected from. All spells of this school will not be able to harm or aid the caster for the duration of this spell (except those spells which can only affect their casters). This includes all spells from this school, including any priest spells that might benefit the caster. Immunity to multiple schools of magic can't be acquired simultaneously.~

@10057 = ~Bigby's Crushing Hand (Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: instantaneous
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a huge disembodied fist that crushes the target. Upon being cast, the spell immediately inflicts 4D10 crushing damage with no saving throw. The target's magic resistance (if any) cannot block the spell's effect.~

@10063 = ~Spirit Armor (Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the 3rd level spell Ghost Armor in that it creates a corporeal barrier around the targets body for the duration of the spell. This spell taps the target's life force in order to create the barrier. The armor itself is weightless, and does not hinder movement or spellcasting at all.

The spirit armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor, however dexterity bonus' still apply as well as magic rings and a shield. While in effect the AC (armor class) of the recipient will be 1, as if he was wearing full plate. Also, due to the magical nature of the spell, he will also receive a +3 bonus to save vs. spells.

There is a danger however, as when the spell runs out the external portion of the spirit is temporarily lost, inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon the target.~

@10064 = ~CAVALIER: This class represents the most common picture of the knight: the gentleman warrior who epitomizes honor, courage and loyalty. He is specialized in battling 'classical' evil monsters such as demons and dragons.

Advantages:
-  Bonus +3 to hit and +3 to damage against all demonic and draconic creatures.
-  May cast 'remove fear' 1 time per day per level
-  Immune to charm
-  Immune to poison
-  20% resistance to fire
-  20% resistance to acid

Disadvantages:
-  May not use missile weapons~

@10065 = ~A magical barrier protects the altar. You do not have the required wardstone to dispel it.~

@10066 = ~There is still another object implanted into the pedestal. You need a special device to pull it out.~

@10070 = ~You turned off the machine.~

@10071 = ~Suddenly you feel completely revitalized and realize that all of your spells and abilities are returned to you as if you'd rested. Someone or something has apparently stepped in to aid you, but you have no idea of the source behind the help you've received.~

@10072 = ~Mental Agility~

@10073 = ~Recast Vital Energy (Necromancy)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster projects a portion of his or her force of life to reshape it and create different effects. However, it is likely that the caster loses his control over the unleashed force; if this happens, the projected energy will cause something dangerous to happen. Wiser mages will know better than others how to keep the energy under control. Once the caster takes control over the energy, he or she will have the option to reshape it to different useful effects. True necromancers can sometimes reshape their vital energy to better and more useful forms than other wizards.~

@10074 = ~With pleasure! I will also activate the alarm to call the guards I keep in reserve for such cases.~

@10075 = ~Ice Storm (Evocation)

@10077 = ~'Protection From Magic Energy' on all party members.~

@10078 = ~This powerful elixir imbues the drinker with 50% resistance to magic damage. The effect lasts for 3 turns, making this potion slightly more battle specific.

Special: All saving throws are made automatically and immunity to 'Greater Malison' spell.
Duration: 3 turns~

@10079 = ~Harp of Discord
Even the most talented bard cannot get this harp to play in tune. Each stroke of the harp's strings results in a harsh, off-key note. If the bard attempts to play a proper ballad upon the harp, its magical effects are released.

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier comes into being in front of the wizard. It sets the wizard's base armor class to 6, and grants an additional +3 bonus to AC against missile and blunt weapons. It is cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The shield spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. The effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: caster

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were scale mail armor. It sets the wizard's base armor class to 6, and grants an additional +3 bonus to AC against piercing and slashing weapons. It is cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out.~

@10085 = ~Staff of the Woodlands
Known only as the "Wild Man of the Wood", the man that carried this staff was a legendary figure near Trademeet until the day he died and returned to the soil. Those who saw him remember his dark, bark-like skin, a feature that would fade if the staff were set aside. He would harass irresponsible loggers and poachers, and old-timers tell of mercenaries chasing him who saw the power of the staff: as the vegetation trembled with the "Wild Man's" magical calling, there formed a green, rotting mix of life and death that shambled overtop of the terrified soldiers, killing them all.

This spell creates a faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the minor globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the minor globe. Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe doesn't block Remove Magic and Dispel Magic spells, but can't be brought down by them either.~

Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The priest employs this spell to set up a globe of razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around the caster, creating a dangerous barrier. Any creature attempting to pass through the blade barrier suffers 10D10 points of damage. Creatures within the area of the barrier when it is invoked are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell at -2. If this is successful, the blades are avoided and no damage is suffered. Stoneskin and Iron Skins spells can also block the blades' damage, though each time the blades will remove one layer of the skins. Certain magical creatures such as rakshasas and liches are immune to the blades and won't take any damage. The barrier remains for ten rounds.~

Any creature attempting to pass through the blade barrier suffers 8d8 points of damage. Creatures within the area of the barrier when it is invoked are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. If this is successful, the blades are avoided and no damage is suffered. Stoneskin and Iron Skins spells can also block the blades' damage, though each time the blades will remove one layer of the skins. Certain magical creatures such as rakshasas and liches are immune to the blades and won't take any damage. The barrier remains for ten rounds.~

Saving Throw: 1/2

When a call lightning spell is cast, it must be cast outside, otherwise it will not work and the spell is wasted. The caster is able to call down bolts of lightning. The caster can call down one bolt per turn.  The spell has a duration of one turn for every four levels of the caster. Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points for each of the caster's experience levels. Thus, a 8th-level caster will call down two bolts, each doing 10d8 (2d8 + 8d8) damage.
The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at any of the priest's enemies.  The first enemy struck by the lightning will be the enemy targeted.  After that any enemy (but not allies) may be struck by the ensuing lightning storm.~

Level: 3

Saving Throw: Special

A dispel magic removes magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of the dispel magic is above the original caster, his chance of success increases by 5%. If the level of the caster of dispel magic is below the original caster, his chance of success will be zero. However, regardless of the levels there is always 1% chance of failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Intuitively, this spell is useless if the target is higher level than the caster (except for Mirror Image which is always dispelled and potions which are counted as 10th level magic).
Note: while this spell dispels the individual effects of grease, web, stinking cloud and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.~

Level: 6

Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects. The first is that the creatures magic resistance will be lowered by 1% per level of the caster. The second is that it will cancel one spell protection of 8th level or lower on the creature. For example if this spell was cast by a 15th level wizard the target creature would lose 15% magic resistance from his current total reducing it to 0 if less than that remains, as well as cancelling one 8th level or lower spell protection. The list of spells that this includes is: Spell Turning, Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity (except SI: Abjuration), Spell Shield and Globe Of Invulnerability.  Magic resistance does not effect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections. The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster.~

This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target, and if there are two protecting a mage that are the same level the choice is random.~

@10186 = ~Pierce Shield (Abjuration)
Level: 8
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast it launches a massive attack on an enemy wizard's spell defenses. The target's magic resistance will be lowered by 10% + 1% per level of the caster. Next pierce shield will cancel one spell protection of any level. For example if this spell was cast by a 15th level wizard the target creature would lose 25% magic resistance from his current total reducing it to 0 if less than that remains as well as cancelling one spell protection if the mage currently has one. The list of spells that this includes is: Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity (except SI: Abjuration), Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Turning and Spell Shield. Magic resistance does not effect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections. The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster. It cannot be dispelled.~

@10187 = ~You can cast Elemental Summoning spell again if you wish.~

@10188 = ~False Dawn (Evocation)
Sphere: Sun
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

False dawn calls into existence a bright reddish light, as if a sunrise were occurring, within the area of effect. All undead creatures within a false dawn suffer 6d6 points of damage. There is no saving throw against this damage.~

@10189 = ~Iron Skins (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Druid casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the Druid in no way. The effect of this is to protect the Druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level Druid would receive 5 skins. For each skin the Druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level Druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER> but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the Druid until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell's duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the Druid from any area attacks such as Fireball; however, it will protect <PRO_HIMHER> from physical magical attacks such as Magic Missile.~

@10196 = ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though Monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own: they channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The Monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

STUNNING BLOW: All successful attacks within the next round force the victim to save vs. Spell or be stunned. This special ability automatically modifies normal attacks; no targeting needs to be done.

FlURRY OF BLOWS: Agility and prowess are key factors that allow a master of hand-to-hand combat survive in a fight against heavily armed bandits and spell-wielding sorcerers. Trained monks are capable of engaging their opponent with extraordinary speed, effectively doubling the amount of attacks they make. For 3 rounds + 1 round / level, a monk's number of attacks per round doubles.

DIAMOND BODY: Experienced monk channels his inner energy to induce a restorative state that heals the wounds and protects the self.

Cornered countless times, Niu was always successful in using this dagger to escape. In the end, it wasn't an enemy or vengeful victim that felled Niu, but rather old age.

When activated, several exact duplicates of the ring wearer spring up from nowhere.

@10230 = ~Perform Ritual~

@10231 = ~AVENGER: A member of a special sect within the druidic order, a Druid of this type is dedicated to fighting those who would defile nature. Avengers have combat powers the average Druid does not—additional abilities that have been earned through extensive training, rituals and communions with entities from higher planes, a process that is very physically draining and forces them to give up some of their affinity towards nature and special powers that come with it.

Advantages:
- Gains two stars in two-handed weapon mastery.
- May achieve mastery in staffs and spears.
- May achieve specialization in weapons that are allowed to the druid domain.
- Seven spells are added to <PRO_HISHER> repertoire, all the way up to the 7th level. These are listed below:

1st level: Remove Fear.
2nd level: Draw Upon Holy Might.
3rd level: Protection from Cold.
4rd level: Holy Power.
5th level: Righteous Magic.
6th level: Giant Strength.
7th level: Protection from the Elements.

- May use Combat Trance ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 6 levels thereafter.
- At 9th level, receives a special ability Conjure Clan Spirit.
- Gains a special high level ability Perform Ritual.

Disadvantages:
- May not wear armor heavier than studded leather.
- Does not receive the usual druidic immunities and bonuses.
- Does not possess the ability to shapeshift.
- Cannot become proficient in ranged weaponry and single weapon.
- Lacks the ability to cast certain powerful druidic spells.
- Cannot dual class.

COMBAT TRANCE: From the early days, Avengers are trained to enter a trance-like state of focus. This skill, similar in spirit to focused rage of a barbarian, is achieved purely from physical training and conditioning. It allows the druid to become faster and stronger in melee combat. When in a trance state, the druids gains +1 extra attack per round and +2 bonus to <PRO_HISHER> attack and damage rolls for 1 turn.

CONJURE CLAN SPIRIT: From the early days of their training, members of the Avenger sect practice a ritual that brings them into a state of shared consciousness. As their grasp on each others' internal energy increases, clan members gain an ability to call forth an ancestral spirit. The spectre will possess abilities and powers of the source, but the strength depends directly on the summoner's experience.

PERFORM RITUAL: This ability allows the Avenger to perform a secret ritual that was perfected by members of the order. It is the ultimate reason why the druid has to sacrifice his connection to the nature. When the ritual is initiated, the Avenger attains a state of etherealness, as if stepping outside the material plane. Entering such state allows the Avenger to move faster and avoid constrictive areas. Due to his partial presense in the physical world, the druid becomes harder to hit by ordinary melee and magic attacks. Any type of magic that constricts the druid's movement has no effect on <PRO_HISHER>.

Range: 240 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, <PRO_HESHE> calls forth a mass of venomous, biting and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpetlike mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all creatures within 30 ft. of the target. Those trapped by the insects suffer 2 points of damage each second and a spell failure rate of 100%. For each round the victim remains inside the cloud, <PRO_HESHE> must make a Save vs. Spell at -2 or run away in fear for one round. The advantage of Creeping Doom over its 5th-level counterpart Insect Plague is that it does twice as much damage in half the amount of time.~

@10244 = ~Such is the age of this sword that its true origin has been lost to time, but markings hint that it was possibly forged in the service of Helm. Also called the "Sword of Neutrality," it seems designed to seek and terminate extremes, to shift the universe closer to harmonious equilibrium. The further the behavior of a target from true balance, the more potent the damage they suffer.

@10245 = ~Thistledown Gloves~

@10246 = ~A sturdy pair of gloves tailored from the hide of Tabitha, a ferocious animal which once accompanied the Beastmaster of Copper Coronet. Embroidered with the Thistledown cloth, they feel very light and tingly on your skin. The rare elven material seems to come alive and tug gently at the essence of the animal. Perhaps, a master craftsman knows how to reveal the hidden magic that lurks inside and channel it into a true enchantment.~

@10247 = ~Paws of the Furious Cat~

@10248 = ~A sturdy pair of gloves tailored from the hide of Tabitha, a ferocious animal which once accompanied the Beastmaster of Copper Coronet.

A master smith has turned the concealed power of the beast's hide into an enchantment using the thistledown cloth as the conduit. The wearer becomes more agile and fast in close combat, obtaining cat-like reflexes and speed.

@10261 = ~Darkened Glory +2~
@10262 = ~Darkened Glory +2

This weapon was originally owned by a young officer guarding a diplomatic envoy from Kara-Tur. When the envoy's caravan was ambushed by a small band of yuan-ti raiders, most of the guards were quickly dispatched during a surprise attack, save for one wagon and the young woman defending it. In wave after wave, the yuan-ti charged at the officer, and in wave after wave, they were cut down by the speed and fury of her steel. At last the leader of the yuan-ti raiders faced off with the young woman, and although he did finally overpower her, he was astonished by her skill. The katana she carried was recovered and later enchanted by a high priest of Sseth. The once graceful blade was tainted by dark magic and now guides those who wield it to inflict the severest of wounds upon their enemies.

@10263 = ~Solemn Duty +3~
@10264 = ~Solemn Duty +3

Not much is known about this katana; its true origin has been lost to time. The edge of the blade has been sharpened to perfection, giving the wielder a chance to slay an opponent with a single blow, unless they can somehow survive the sudden loss of their head. Markings engraved upon the hilt suggest that the sword is especially potent when used against creatures from the outer planes, while protective enchantments keep the wielder's mind clear of doubt and focus <PRO_HISHER> will. Who originally commissioned the creation of this weapon, or why, remains a mystery. Two words are etched into the blade itself: "Solemn Duty."

@10265 = ~Githzerai Blade +5~
@10266 = ~Githzerai Blade +5

This sword was the weapon of choice of the famous githzerai Dak'kon. Dak'kon was killed by a powerful entity while working for a creature known as the "Nameless One."

The blade was reforged by a master smith. With the essence of many fine weapons constructed by beings residing outside of the material plane imbued in it, the sword possesses an eery, out-of-this-world look. A simple act of holding the blade in one's hand gives a strong sense of inner peace, focus and determination.

After some pondering, he quietly warns you: "This powerful axe is evil". Combined from parts of cursed weapons worn by deranged warriors and strengthened with potent potions of barbarian essence, it emanates a sense of doom and disaster. Only someone who feels no mercy or remorse whatsoever would be capable of wielding it.

@11098 = ~Hood of the Honorless

Marceloni was an avid patron of the various gambling dens in Calimport. The annals can thank the perspicacity (or greed) of a wandering diviner for the discovery of the gambler's true identity. A hooded figure would appear in every tavern and vanish into the shadows, departing for another playing house. His swiftness of hands was too quick for an untrained eye, yet it did not appear to be cheating. A few disgruntled players simply refered to the thief as "The Honorless". The shadowy figure was also more than capable of demonstrating the extent of his "professionalism" in the back alleys if need be. Eventually, a diviner, who was almost as greedy as The Honorless himself, suspected a wrongdoing in the hooded man's reluctance to take off the piece of cloth wrapped around his head, let alone part with it. The diviner discovered a magical aura of the hood and Marceloni received a beating long overdue. The thief disappeared, and the unique piece of garment was considered to be lost.
